# Chess Opening Trainer
Training program for memorising chess openings

**(--- Still under construction ---)**

Try it here: https://gavbarnett.github.io/chess-opening-trainer/

## Goal
Simple app to play through opening moves against AI until either:
1. Out of opening (20 moves?, all minor pieces developed, castled, or, ...?) 
3. User makes significant opening error (i.e. eval drops by -X, or to -Y)

AI should play a variety of responses to aid training.

If an opening error is made the "best move" is shown to the user with some informtion (arrows, and/or follow up moves)

At which point a new game is started with the sides flipped.

## Secondary goals
* Publish as an Android App
* Add a way of keeping score (gamify)
